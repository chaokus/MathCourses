Problem with Course API

/v1/courses
can't be queried to get a unique course.
For example,
subject-area-code: MATH
catalog-number: H1B

returns more than one course, e.g. H1BS, H1B.


cs-course-id
H1BS:	114723
H1B:	114722


/v1/courses/{id}
allows for querying with some unique id
but for some reason some courses can't be located by cs-course-id
For example, H1B can't be found using its cs-course-id: 114722
but can be found using
cms-id:	07030a88-25cb-4e90-b5fe-708756e1d28a
or
cms-version-independent-id:	e04321c6-3989-41ee-bb3e-4147f6ee7d30


solution? : probably have to use /v1/courses and match the catalog-number or cs-course-id again.
